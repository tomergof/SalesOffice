# SalesOffice

**This project was written while learning the basics of object oriented programing in Java**

## What is this project about
This project aims to simulate the work of a sales office.
It simulates the process from the clientâ€™s point of view when buying a ticket.
I used the basics tools of inheritance, abstract, exceptions and data structures to build the system.
